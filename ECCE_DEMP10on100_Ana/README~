Analysis module for 10 on 100 GeV DEMP events after having pass through the Fun4All simulation. Research is for the future EIC (Diffractive and Tagging working group).

Drawn from Stephen Kay's analysis module : https://github.com/sjdkay/ECCE_DEMP_Analysis.

Installation

1) To install virtual machine (VM), follow directions from the following link : https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/Singularity/blob/master/VirtualBox.md.

2) The following steps will install general EIC macros onto the VM:
Within VM:
Open new terminal
~/singularity_shell.sh
source setup.sh
mkdir work
cd work
git clone https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/macros
git clone https://github.com/ECCE-EIC/tutorials

# SJDK - 14/08/22 - Note, no need to clone this repo separately, it comes with ECCE_DEMP_Analysis now, skip to mkdir and onwards
3) Specifically for cloning this repository:
Within work directory of VM:
git clone https://github.com/maggiefekerr/ECCE_DEMP5on41_Analysis
# SJDK 14/08/22 - Skip to here!
mkdir ECCE_DEMP10on100
cd ECCE_DEMP10on100
CreateSubsysRecoModule.pl ECCE_DEMP10on100
cp ~/work/tutorials/CaloAna/src/*.[sa]* .
cp ~/work/ECCE_DEMP_Analysis/ECCE_DEMP10n100_Ana/configure.ac ./
cp ~/work/ECCE_DEMP_Analysis/ECCE_DEMP10on100_Ana/Makefile.am ./
chmod +x autogen.sh
mkdir build
cd build
../autogen.sh --prefix=$MYINSTALL
make install

4) Copying in the latest version of the respository and then rebuilding your directory
Within ~/work/ECCE_DEMP10on100/build directory:
cp /home/fun4all/work/ECCE_DEMP_Analysis/ECCE_DEMP10on100_Ana/ECCE_DEMP10on100.* ../ && make

# SJDK 19/10/22 - There's a separate G4_User and Fun4all_reana for each beam energy
5) Whenever you are rebuilding your plugin (it is recommended to make changes to G4_User.C and Fun4all_reana.C within your ECCE_DEMP10on100_Analysis repository):
cd /home/fun4all/work/macros/detectors/EICDetector
cp ~/work/ECCE_DEMP5on41_Analysis/main_macro/G4_User.C .
cp ~/work/ECCE_DEMP5on41_Analysis/main_macro/Fun4all_reana.C .
